# Set Input Mode: Game And UI

**Plugin:** StateTreeToolsCore
**Category:** Input
**Availability:** StateTree Tools **2.0+**

Calls Unreal's Set Input Mode Game And UI function on a bound `APlayerController`. Use this when both the game and the UI need to receive input simultaneously â€” for example, a heads-up overlay that accepts clicks without blocking game controls.

---

## Configuration

### Player Controller *(input, optional)*
Bind this to the `APlayerController` you want to set input mode on. If not bound or invalid the task fails.

### Widget To Focus *(input, optional)*
Bind this to the widget that should receive focus when the input mode is applied. Leave unbound to apply the mode without explicitly focusing a widget.

### Mouse Lock Mode
Controls how the mouse cursor is locked to the viewport. Default: **Do Not Lock**.

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| Do Not Lock | Cursor moves freely |
| Lock On Capture | Locked only while a mouse button is held |
| Lock Always | Always locked to the viewport |
| Lock In Fullscreen | Locked only when the application is fullscreen |

### Hide Cursor During Capture
When enabled, the cursor is hidden while the mouse is temporarily captured (e.g. during a mouse-down drag). Default: on.

### Flush Input
When enabled, flushes any pending input events immediately after switching modes. Default: off.

## When to Fire

By default the mode is set when the state is **entered**. You can also set it on **exit**, with separate toggles for which exit reasons trigger the call (Stopped, Succeeded, or Failed). See [Enter / Exit Firing](/StateTreeTools/enter-exit-firing) for a full explanation.

## Error Handling

If **Player Controller** is invalid the task will fail. You can control whether a failure causes the task to return **Failed** or **Succeeded** using the **Error Means Failure** option.
